### Recommended settings for a better experience

The font in the preview images is **IBM Plex Mono**, which can be downloaded for free from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I've added some personal typography-related settings, which you can achieve by adding the following to your `settings.json` file.

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "'IBM Plex Mono', monospace",
"editor.fontSize": 16.5,
"editor.fontWeight": "400",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.lineHeight": 38,
```

### Customize/Override theme colors

You can customize/override the AlterNight theme colors by adding the following theme-specific configuration to your settings file. For more advanced customization, refer to the corresponding [VS Code Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme).
