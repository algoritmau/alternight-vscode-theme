### Recommended settings for a better experience

The font in the preview images is **IBM Plex Mono**, which can be downloaded for free from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I've added some personal typography-related settings, which you can achieve by adding the following to your `settings.json` file.

```json
// Controls the font family
"editor.fontFamily": "'IBM Plex Mono', monospace",
// Controls the font size
"editor.fontSize": 16.5,
// Controls the font weight
"editor.fontWeight": "400",
// Controls the line height. If you prefer to compute the lineHeight from the fontSize, use 0
"editor.lineHeight": 38,
// Enables font ligatures
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

### Customize/Override theme colors
